1. What's the difference between man and what is?
•	Think of man as a full instruction manual for a command. If you type man ls, you'll get a detailed guide with examples, options, and explanations.
•	what is more like a quick summary. If you type  ls, you'll get a one-line description, such as "ls (1) - list directory contents".
•	So, use man when you want the whole story, and  when you just want a quick intro.

2. How do you use tee to save and display the output of ls -l?
•	If you want to see the list of files in your folder and also save that list to a file, run:
bash
ls -l | tee output.txt
•	This shows the output on your screen and saves it to output.txt at the same time.

3. How can tee help with logging?
•	Imagine you're running a script and want to watch its progress live, but also keep a record. You can do:
bash
./myscript.sh | tee log.txt
•	Now, you see everything as it happens, and later you can check log.txt for the full history.

4. What are the steps to install Ubuntu 25.04 LTS on Oracle VirtualBox?
1.	Download the Ubuntu 25.04 LTS ISO from the official site.
2.	Open VirtualBox and click "New" to create a new virtual machine.
3.	Name it (like "Ubuntu 25.04"), set type to Linux, and version to Ubuntu (64-bit).
4.	Choose how much RAM to give it (at least 4 GB is good).
5.	Create a virtual hard disk (25 GB or more).
6.	Start the VM and select the ISO file as the startup disk.
7.	Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.
8.	When done, remove the ISO and reboot the VM to start using Ubuntu.

5. What if you get a Kernel Panic Error during Ubuntu installation?
•	First, check if your ISO file is corrupted—try downloading it again.
•	Make sure your VM has enough RAM and the right settings (like enabling virtualization).
•	Try turning off EFI or changing the chipset in VirtualBox settings.
•	If you see a specific error message, search for it online for more targeted help.
•	Sometimes, just restarting the VM or tweaking settings fixes it.

6. How do you display and change the system's hostname?
•	To see your computer's name, type:
bash

•	Usually, you'd use:
bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newname
