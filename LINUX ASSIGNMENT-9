21. Shell script to check if a number is even or odd
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if (( num % 2 == 0 )); then
    echo "$num is even"
else
    echo "$num is odd"
fi
22. Difference between if and case statements in bash
•	if statement: Used for conditional execution, supports complex logical conditions and multiple comparisons.
•	case statement: Used for pattern matching against a variable, simpler and cleaner for multiple discrete value checks.
•	if is better for complex conditions; case is more efficient and readable for checking multiple specific values.
23. Script to find the largest of three numbers
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter three numbers:"
read a b c
if (( a >= b && a >= c )); then
    echo "$a is the largest"
elif (( b >= a && b >= c )); then
    echo "$b is the largest"
else
    echo "$c is the largest"
fi
24. For loop to traverse an array in bash
bash
arr=(123 "Abs" -2.3 'A' 23.56 0)
for element in "${arr[@]}"
do
    echo "$element"
done
25. Shell script to loop through all files in current directory and display their names
bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *
do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "$file"
    fi
done
26. Difference between while and until loops in bash
•	while loop: Repeats as long as the condition is true.
•	until loop: Repeats as long as the condition is false (opposite of while).
27. Countdown timer script using a while loop
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the countdown start number:"
read count
while [ $count -ge 0 ]
do
    echo $count
    ((count--))
    sleep 1
done
echo "Countdown finished!"
28. Using break and continue statements in loops
•	break: Exits the loop completely.
•	continue: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
Example:
bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        continue  # skip when i=3
    fi
    if [ $i -eq 4 ]; then
        break   # exit loop when i=4
    fi
    echo $i
done
29. Script to check if a file exists or not using if and else
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the filename:"
read filename
if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
    echo "$filename exists."
else
    echo "$filename does not exist."
fi
30. Script to calculate factorial of a number using for loop
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
fact=1
for (( i=1; i<=num; i++ ))
do
    fact=$((fact * i))
done
echo "Factorial of $num is $fact"
