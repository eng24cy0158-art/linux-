1.	Which command lists files and folders in a directory?
The ls command shows you the stuff inside a folder. Just like opening a drawer to look inside, typing ls lets you see what’s there. If you want to see more details like file sizes and dates, use ls -l. It’s like looking with a magnifying glass!

2.	How to create a new folder named 123test_dir?
Think of mkdir as “make a new box.” By typing:
mkdir 123test_dir
you’re telling the computer to make a new empty folder named 123test_dir where you can store things later.

3.	What does the sed command do?
sed is like a magical text editor that can quickly find words and replace them in files without opening them. For example, if you want to swap every “apple” with “orange” in a list, you can run:
sed 's/apple/orange/g' file.txt
and it will do all those swaps for you at once.

4.	Which command shows quick one-line explanations of commands?
Use whatis to get a fast idea about what a command does, like a dictionary giving you a quick meaning. For example:
whatis ls
might tell you “ls - list files,” so you know basically what it is.

5.	How to make an empty file named notes.txt?
Typing:
touch notes.txt
creates a brand-new empty file named notes.txt. It’s like putting a blank page on your desk, ready for writing.

6.	What’s the difference between grep and awk?
•	grep searches for certain words or phrases inside files. Like scanning a book for all the times “error” shows up:
grep "error" file.log
•	awk is more like a smart helper that not only finds words but can also pick out parts of sentences and do things with them. For example, show the second word on every line:
awk '{print $2}' file.log

7.	How to give the file owner full permission to read, change, and run a file called script.sh?
Use:
chmod u+rwx script.sh
This means you (the owner) can open, edit, and execute the file whenever you want.

8.	How are chown and chgrp different?
•	chown changes who owns the file, like passing ownership of a book.
Example:
chown alice file.txt
•	chgrp changes which group the file belongs to, like putting the book on a group’s bookshelf.
Example:
chgrp developers file.txt

9.	If you can’t run a file even though it’s there, how to fix?
•	Check who owns the file and what permissions it has by typing:
ls -l filename
•	Find out which user you are with:
whoami
•	If you see you don’t have permission to run the file, add execute permission with:
chmod u+x filename

10.	How to find .log files changed in the last 2 days in /var/log, show them on screen, and save the list?
Use this command:
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime -2 | tee recent_logs.txt
It searches for .log files changed recently, shows them to you, and saves their names in a file called recent_logs.txt.
