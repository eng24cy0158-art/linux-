VMSTAT COMMAND:
(1) What is the vmstat command? (History, invention, authors)
vmstat means Virtual Memory Statistics.
It is a built-in Unix/Linux command used to check the overall performance of a system.
Short History
First introduced in BSD Unix in the late 1970s–1980s.
Later included in System V Unix.
Today, the Linux version comes from the procps/procps-ng project, maintained by Linux open-source developers.
Purpose
It gives information about:
Memory usage
CPU activity
Processes
Swap memory
Disk I/O
In simple words:
👉 vmstat shows how healthy your system is.

(2) Why is vmstat useful for System Administrators?
System administrators use vmstat because it helps them:
✔ Monitor memory
Find if RAM is free, used, cached, or swapped.
✔ Detect CPU load
Check if CPU is idle or overloaded.
✔ Detect system performance problems
Helpful when the system is slow or hanging.
✔ Identify I/O bottlenecks
Find if the disk is reading/writing too much.
✔ Troubleshoot in real time
Using vmstat <seconds> to watch live changes.
In short:
👉 vmstat helps admins understand what is happening inside the system at that moment.

(3) How does the vmstat command work? (With example)
Basic command
vmstat
This shows a single report of system performance.
Example Output
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0  82000  12000 250000    0    0     5    10  200  300  5  3 90  2  0
Meaning (simple)
r – number of processes waiting for CPU
free – free RAM
cache – cached memory
us, sy, id – CPU usage (user, system, idle)
So, vmstat quickly shows the overall status of your system.

(4) Snapshots (simple illustrated examples)
Snapshot 1: Running vmstat
$ vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 0  0      0 102500  20000 300400    0    0     3     5  180  250  4  2 92  2  0
Snapshot 2: Continuous monitoring
$ vmstat 2
procs ---------memory----------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0  98000  21000 310000    0    0     5     9  150  210 10  5 82  3  0
 2  1      0  96000  21000 315000    0    0     8     4  170  230 12  4 80  4  0

(5) Options & Flags (5–6 important ones)
1. vmstat -s — Show detailed memory statistics
vmstat -s
Displays readable, summary numbers.
2. vmstat -a — Show active & inactive memory
vmstat -a
3. vmstat -d — Show disk statistics
vmstat -d
4. vmstat -D — Summary disk statistics
vmstat -D
5. vmstat -p /dev/sda1 — Show stats for a partition
vmstat -p /dev/sda1
6. vmstat -t — Timestamp in output
vmstat -t 2

VMSTAT 2 COMMAND:

(1) What is the command? (History, invention, authors)
vmstat 2 is a Linux/Unix command that runs vmstat but refreshes the system statistics every 2 seconds.
Short History
vmstat was introduced in early UNIX systems in the late 1970s.
It became part of BSD UNIX and later System V UNIX.
The Linux version used today comes from the procps-ng package.
It has been built and improved by many UNIX engineers and open-source developers over many years.
In simple words:
vmstat 2 is the live-monitoring version of vmstat, showing system health every 2 seconds.

(2) Why is vmstat 2 useful for System Administrators?
System admins use vmstat 2 mainly because it shows real-time updates.
It is useful for:
✔ Watching CPU usage change live
✔ Monitoring memory usage over time
✔ Detecting sudden spikes in processes
✔ Observing disk I/O activity happening every few seconds
✔ Checking if the system slows down randomly
✔ Live performance troubleshooting
In simple words:
vmstat 2 works like a “live heartbeat monitor” for the system.

(3) How does vmstat 2 work? (With example)
The basic command is:
vmstat 2
2 means refresh the info every 2 seconds
It keeps running until you press CTRL + C
Example Output
$ vmstat 2
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff   cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0  95000  12000 270000    0    0    12    14  150  200 10  3 85  2  0
 2  1      0  90000  12000 275000    0    0     8     5  165  215 14  5 78  3  0
 1  0      0  92000  12000 280000    0    0     5     8  140  190  9  2 88  1  0
What’s happening here?
Every 2 seconds, you see new values.
If CPU or memory usage changes, you can see it immediately.
This is why the command is great for live monitoring.
