1.	What is a bash shell script? Give an example.
A bash shell script is like a list of commands written in a file that the computer can follow step by step. It helps you do tasks automatically instead of typing commands one by one.
Example:
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
This script says “Hello World” when you run it.

2.	Write a simple shell script to print “Hello World”.
Just write this in a file:
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
When you run it, it will show "Hello World" on the screen.

3.	Why do we use comments (#) in shell scripts?
Comments start with #. They are notes you write to explain what your script does. The computer ignores them, but they help people understand the script better.

4.	How to declare variables like int, float, string, etc., in bash?
In bash, you just assign a value to a name; you don’t have to say the type. For example:
bash
age=25
price=9.99
name="Alice"
is_valid=true
char="A"
Bash treats all as text but you can use them as numbers or words.

5.	Write a shell script to show the current date and time.
Here’s a small script:
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Current Date and Time: $(date)"
It shows the date and time when you run it.

6.	Difference between constant and variable in bash.
•	A variable can change anytime.
•	A constant is like a variable you don’t want to change.
In bash, you can make a variable constant by using readonly. For example:
bash
readonly PI=3.14
After this, PI can’t be changed.

7.	Shell script to read two numbers from user and add them.
Here you go:
bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter 1st number: " num1
read -p "Enter 2nd number: " num2
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "Sum is $sum"
It asks for two numbers, adds them, and shows the total.

8.	What does the source command do?
source runs a script inside the current shell. It’s like copying all the commands into your current session so any variables or changes stay after it finishes.
________________________________________
9.	How to debug a shell script? Two ways.
•	Run the script with this command to see each step:
bash -x script.sh
•	Or add set -x at the start of your script to turn on debugging, and set +x to turn it off later.

10.	Bash script to create and delete a file.
Here’s a simple one:
bash
#!/bin/bash
file="tempfile.txt"
touch $file
echo "$file created"
rm $file
echo "$file deleted"
It makes a file called tempfile.txt then deletes it and tells you what it did.
